Project Title: Aptos Creator-Verse

The Problem:-
The creator economy is fragmented and inefficient. Creators struggle with proving and protecting their intellectual property, receiving timely and transparent royalties, and monetizing content through micro-payments. This lack of a cohesive ecosystem hinders fair compensation and genuine fan engagement.

The Solution:-
Aptos Creator-Verse is a decentralized platform built to empower creators. We are reimagining how creators and fans interact, own, and monetize digital content by leveraging the unique strengths of the Aptos blockchain. Our solution provides:

AI-Powered IP Registration: Securely register content as an immutable NFT on the blockchain, creating a non-fungible proof of ownership.

Fractionalized IP Ownership: Tokenize content royalty streams, allowing fans to invest and become co-owners.

Real-Time Royalty Distribution: Use smart contracts to instantly and automatically distribute micro-payments to all stakeholders as content is consumed.

Decentralized Fan Engagement: Foster a deeper community connection through creator-led DAOs.

Why Aptos?
Aptos is the optimal foundation for this project:

Parallel Execution (Block-STM): Crucial for handling the high volume of simultaneous transactions, ensuring a smooth and scalable user experience.

High Transaction Throughput & Low Fees: Makes real-time, micro-payment distribution for content consumption economically viable.

Move Programming Language: Provides a secure, asset-centric model that ensures the integrity and predictable handling of digital assets.

Project Structure
Our repository is organized into a clean, modular structure to facilitate development and maintenance.

Roadmap
Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Implement core smart contracts for IP registration and fractionalized ownership.

Build a basic front-end to allow creators to upload content and mint ownership NFTs.

Enable a simple fan dashboard to view and purchase fractionalized IP tokens.

Integrate a mock or test-net royalty distribution system.

Phase 2: Advanced Functionality

Integrate the AI-powered cryptographic fingerprinting model.

Develop the real-time, smart-contract-based royalty distribution system with an external API.

Build out the DAO governance features for fan communities.

Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion

Create a marketplace for fractionalized IP tokens.

Onboard early-adopter creators and their content.

Focus on optimizing the user experience and platform security.

How to Run the Project
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

Prerequisites:

Aptos CLI: To compile and deploy the Move smart contracts.

Node.js & npm: To manage the frontend dependencies.

Rust: The Move language is built on Rust.

Installation:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/sinamchayan/Aptos-Creator-Verse.git
cd Aptos-Creator-Verse
Install frontend dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts:

Navigate to the smart contracts directory and use the Aptos CLI to compile and publish the Move modules to your local or test network.

Example command (ensure your ~/.aptos/config.yaml is set up):

Bash

aptos move compile --named-addresses CreatorVerse=default
aptos move publish --named-addresses CreatorVerse=default

Run the application:
npm run dev
Bash

npm run dev
